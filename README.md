Submitted by - Adam Heaton

App - [https://minutekey-project.herokuapp.com/](https://minutekey-project.herokuapp.com/)

### Dependencies
Many of these are for Linting, others are for `Babel` and `Webpack` to work, and the rest are `Vue.js` related. 

In order to get Vue and Vuetify working quikly, a big chunk of these came from this repository: https://github.com/barnesheaton/where-to-run

`webpack-dev-server` and `chokidar` allow for hot reloading of the local app
